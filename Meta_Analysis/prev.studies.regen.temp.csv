"Table X. Previous studies investigating coral growth and regeneration post experimental injury in contrasting temperature regimes. The table displays each study with the associated injury and temperature treatments and whether coral growth and regeneration increased (+ ), decreased (-), or if there was no effect (∅).  Tradeoffs  between coral  growth and regeneration and synergistic interactions between treatments are also displayed. Unreported data is denoted by NA. ",,,,,,,
